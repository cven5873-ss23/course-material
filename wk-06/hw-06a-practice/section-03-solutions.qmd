treatment <- read_csv(here("wk-05/hw-05a-practice/data/what_a_waste/what-a-waste-city-level-data-treatment.csv"))

```

# Task 3.1

1.  Starting with the `treatment` data object, use functions taught during the course to answer the following question:

How many cities are covered in this dataset?

```{r}

treatment |> 
  group_by(city) |> 
  summarise(count = n()) |> 
  summarise(count = n()) 


```

# Task 3.2

1.  Starting with the `treatment` data object, use functions taught during the course to answer the following question:

In how many cities is all waste (100%) openly dumped?

```{r}

treatment |> 
  filter(waste_treatment == "open_dump" & percent == 100) |>  
  summarise(count = n()) 


```

# Task 3.3

1.  Starting with the `treatment` data object, use functions taught during the course to answer the following question:

How many cities in which no waste (0%) is recycled fall into each income category?

```{r}

treatment |> 
  filter(waste_treatment == "recycling" & percent == 0) |> 
  group_by(income_id) |> 
  summarise(count = n()) 


```

# Task 3.4

1.  Starting with the `treatment` data object, use functions taught during the course to answer the following question:

What is the mean, median, and standard deviation of treatment percentages for each waste treatment option and grouped by income?

```{r}

treatment |> 
  group_by(waste_treatment, income_id) |>
  summarise( 
    mean = mean(percent),
    median = median(percent), 
    sd = sd(percent)
  ) 


```

# Task 3.5

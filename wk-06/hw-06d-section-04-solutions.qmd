# Task 4.1

1.  Starting with the `treatment_mean` data object, use functions taught during the course to complete the following task:

Reproduce the table that you see as an image below when you render the report and view the output in your Viewer tab in the bottom right window.

```{r}

treatment_mean %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = income_id, 
              values_from = mean) |> 
  knitr::kable(digits = 1)

```

# Task 4.2

1.  Starting with the `treatment_mean` data object, use functions taught during the course to complete the following task:

Reproduce the plot that you see as an image below when you render the report and view the output in your Viewer tab in the bottom right window.

**Hints:**

-   The color palette is for qualitative data types and is called "Paired". It is originally derived from from https://colorbrewer2.org/

-   Wondering about the order of the 4 individual plots? Remember how we create factors?

```{r}

income_fct_level <- c("LIC", "LMC", "UMC", "HIC") 

treatment_mean_fct <- treatment_mean |> 
  mutate(income_id = factor(income_id, levels = income_fct_level))  

ggplot(data = treatment_mean_fct,
       mapping = aes(x = waste_treatment, y = mean, fill = waste_treatment)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Waste Treatment", 
       subtitle = "Mean percentages for countries by income regions", 
       x = "mean (percent)", 
       y = NULL) + 
  scale_fill_brewer(type = "qual", palette = "Paired") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 40, 5)) +
  facet_wrap(~income_id) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

# Task 4.3

1.  In the YAML header, change the document format from `html` to `pdf`
2.  Render the document
3.  Open the 'Files' tab in the bottom right window
4.  Navigate to the generated PDF: `wk-05/hw-05a-practice/section-04.pdf`
5.  Tick the box next to the PDF file
6.  Click on 'More' (the blue gear icon) in the menu bar above the file manager
7.  Click on 'Export' and download the PDF file
